# E-Commerce Recommender System

## Overview

This project implements a scalable recommender system using Apache Spark and MLlib. It's designed to handle large-scale e-commerce data and provide personalized product recommendations to users.

## Features

- Collaborative Filtering using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm
- Advanced data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning using Cross-Validation
- Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction using Random Forest
- A/B testing simulation for recommendation quality evaluation
- Integration with Delta Lake for efficient data storage and updates
- MLflow integration for experiment tracking and model versioning
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Configurable via YAML files

## Prerequisites

- Apache Spark 3.0+
- Python 3.7+
- AWS EMR (for deployment)
- MLflow
- Delta Lake

## Installation

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up MLflow:
   ```
   mlflow server --backend-store-uri /path/to/mlflow/data --default-artifact-root /path/to/mlflow/artifacts --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

3. Configure your AWS credentials for EMR access.

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file in the project root directory. Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
app_name: "Production-Grade Advanced Recommender System"
spark_executor_memory: "8g"
spark_driver_memory: "4g"
data_path: "s3://your-bucket/ratings.parquet"
train_test_split: [0.8, 0.2]
user_col: "user_id"
item_col: "item_id"
rating_col: "rating"
als_max_iter: 10
als_reg_param: 0.01
als_rank_values: [10, 50, 100]
als_reg_param_values: [0.01, 0.1, 1.0]
n_recommendations: 10
control_group: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
test_group: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
model_save_path: "s3://your-bucket/als_model"
recommendations_table_path: "s3://your-bucket/recommendations"
mlflow_tracking_uri: "http://your-mlflow-server:5000"
mlflow_experiment_name: "recommender_system_experiment"
```

Adjust the values according to your specific setup and requirements.

## Usage

To run the recommender system:

```
python recommender_system.py config.yaml
```

This will execute the entire pipeline:
1. Load and preprocess the data
2. Train the ALS model
3. Evaluate the model
4. Generate recommendations
5. Train the CTR prediction model
6. Simulate A/B testing
7. Save the model and update recommendations in Delta Lake

## Monitoring and Tracking

- Access the MLflow UI to view experiment runs, compare metrics, and download artifacts:
  ```
  mlflow ui
  ```

- Monitor Spark jobs through the Spark UI or your EMR cluster's management console.

## Extending the System

To extend the system for your specific use case:

1. Modify the `preprocess_data` method to include additional feature engineering steps.
2. Adjust the `train_model` method to experiment with different algorithms or hyperparameters.
3. Enhance the `evaluate_model` method to include additional evaluation metrics relevant to your business goals.
4. Customize the `generate_recommendations` method to implement business rules or constraints.
